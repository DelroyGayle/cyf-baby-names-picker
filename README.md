# Baby Names Picker

## Challenge Overview

Make a React app which shows some baby names and lets you pick your favourites. 

## Requirements

1. Write a React app which lists baby names from the given file.
2. It should display boys' and girls' names differently
3. The names should be displayed in alphabetical order, ascending.
4. Add a search bar.
* When someone types into it, your app should update the displayed list of baby names to only show matches.
* Matches should be case-insensitive.
* When the search bar is clear, all names should be shown
5. Add "favourites"
* When the user clicks a name from the main list, it should be moved to a "favourites" list, displayed separately. 
* It should disappear from the main list!
* When the user clicks a name from the favourites list, it should be moved back to the main list. 
* It should disappear from the favourites list!
6. Add "name gender" filter buttons.
* Add buttons that allow the user to only see boy or girl names (or all names).
* The app should start by showing all names.
